ðŸ“˜Coxygen Global Universities Haskell Practice Projects
Welcome to my Coxygen Global Universities  Haskell practice repository! This project contains a series of small, focused tasks designed to help me learn and master core Haskell conceptsâ€”from basic syntax to type classes and functional patterns.

ðŸ“š Contents
The project is divided into chapters (folders/files), each focused on specific Haskell topics:

Chapter	Topics Covered
HC1	Basic functions, function composition, pure functions
HC2	Type signatures, variables, infix/prefix notation
HC3	Conditionals, guards, let/where bindings
HC4	Pattern matching, tuples, list processing
HC5	Higher-order functions, lambdas, composition
HC6	Recursion, folds, custom map and filter
HC7	Type classes (Eq, Ord, Show, Read), custom type classes
